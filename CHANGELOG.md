## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **OLED auto-dim after inactivity.** The display is bright on any
  activity — splash entry, mode change into a dashboard leaf, packet
  RX/TX — and dims after a short idle window. Splash holds bright for
  10 s, then drops to dim while the LearnMore / Info carousel keeps
  alternating. The dashboard stays bright for 3 s after the last
  packet or mode change, then dims in place without changing
  Listening/Transmitting state. Cross-leaf TX↔RX hops transition
  bright→bright with no intermediate dim — `set_dim` is fired as an
  action by the 3 s timer handler rather than as a sibling `exit:`
  action, so mode-change leaf-crossings never see a flash.
- `DisplayBrightness` trait in `src/driver/mod.rs` unifies the
  two-level backlight API across the `ssd1306` crate's `Ssd1306Async`
  and the in-tree `Sh1106` driver. Contrast values centralized as
  `CONTRAST_BRIGHT` (`0xFF`) and `CONTRAST_DIM` (`0x08`) constants so
  the two levels can be tuned in one place.

### Changed

- `src/display.rs` statechart restructured:
  - `Splash` gains `entry: set_bright` plus an action-only
    `on(after 10s) => set_dim` handler so the splash bright window
    is time-scoped without disturbing the LM↔Info alternation.
  - `Dashboard` `Listening` and `Transmitting` each gain a nested
    `*Bright` substate owning the `entry: set_bright` action. Packet
    handlers moved into the leaves and target the leaf's `*Bright` —
    sibling-to-sibling within the leaf restarts the 3 s timer without
    re-entering the leaf itself (paint / 1 s sparkline timer
    preserved). The 3 s timeout handler fires `set_dim` as an action
    and up-transitions to the leaf, parking the machine at the leaf
    with no active child.
- `On.on(CmdReset)` now targets `LearnMore` directly rather than
  `Splash`. Under hsmc 0.2 up-transition semantics, targeting
  `Splash` from within `Splash.LearnMore` (USB-disconnect race path)
  would only unwind below `Splash` and park with no active child,
  leaving the LM↔Info alternation timer dead and the QR frozen on
  screen.
- `LoRaBoard::DisplayDriver` trait bound extended with
  `+ DisplayBrightness` so brightness is part of the board contract
  alongside `DrawTarget<Color = BinaryColor>`.

### Fixed

- Elecrow ThinkNode-M2 board doc corrected: the shipping revision
  carries a WCH CH340K USB-UART bridge (USB `1a86:7522`), not a
  Silicon Labs CP2102. `just flash elecrow_thinknode_m2` now matches
  the CH340K / CH340 VID:PIDs directly instead of falling through
  to espflash auto-detect.

### Dependencies

- `hsmc` bumped to `0.2` to pick up the up-transition fix (transition
  to an already-active ancestor unwinds only the subtree strictly
  below the target; no exit/entry on the target; no default descent).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-22

Small but high-value behavior change: `SET_CONFIG` issued while the
radio is in continuous RX no longer drops the radio (and the OLED)
back to idle. The radio now auto-re-arms RX with the new modulation
once reconfiguration completes, matching DongLoRa Protocol 1.1's
§3.5 / §6.3 amendments.

### Changed

- `src/radio.rs`: inside `state Receiving`, add `on(ConfigApplied)
  => ResumingRx` to shadow the parent `Configured` state's
  `on(ConfigApplied) => Idle` handler. The reconfigure path now
  runs `apply_set_config` → `ConfigApplied` → `ResumingRx.entry:
  try_start_rx_hw` → `StartRxOk` → `Receiving` without ever
  entering `Idle`.
- The OLED's `Dashboard → Splash` transition was previously driven
  by `RadioEvent::Idle` firing on `Configured.Idle.entry`. That
  event no longer fires during a SET_CONFIG-from-Receiving
  sequence, so the display stays on Dashboard.

### Dependencies

- `donglora-protocol` bumped to `1.1.0` (spec-only change; matches
  the new normative text the firmware now implements).

### Use-case unlock

- Scanner / time-division / dynamic-modulation workflows that
  rotate LoRa parameters mid-RX no longer need to re-issue
  `RX_START` after every `SET_CONFIG`. One call, radio continues
  to receive.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-22

The 1.0 release. Firmware now speaks DongLoRa Protocol v2 end to end,
depends on the freshly-published `donglora-protocol` 1.0.0 and `hsmc`
0.1.0 from crates.io, and ships GitHub Release binaries for every
supported board.

### Breaking

- **DongLoRa Protocol v2 wire format** (wire-incompatible with 0.x
  clients and firmware). Every `type_id`, tag-correlation rule, and
  field layout follows `PROTOCOL.md` v1.0.
- **Host framing replaced.** `src/host/framing.rs` now drives a
  streaming `FrameDecoder` from `donglora-protocol` and emits
  `(type_id, tag, payload)` frames; the 0.x COBS-per-response shim is
  gone.
- **Radio task reshape.** `src/radio.rs` emits v2 `TX_DONE` /
  `SetConfigResult` / `RxPayload` / `RxOrigin` shapes directly; no 0.x
  translation layer remains.

### Changed

- `hsmc` switched from path-dep on the local workspace to
  `version = "0.1.0"` from crates.io.
- `donglora-protocol` switched from path-dep on `../protocol` to
  `version = "1.0.0"` from crates.io; firmware builds are now
  reproducible from a clean checkout with no sibling repo required.
- `PROTOCOL.md` updated to the DongLoRa Protocol v2 normative spec,
  kept byte-for-byte in sync with the `donglora-protocol` crate's
  copy.

### Infrastructure

- Cargo.toml `repository` + `homepage` now point at the canonical
  `https://github.com/donglora/firmware` (the `swaits/donglora`
  repo is archived).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- BLE soft-mesh multiplexer design document (`BLE_MUX_DESIGN_DOC.md`) —
  specification for turning a dongle from a 1:1 USB device into a shared
  near-field radio gateway for multiple BLE-attached phones. Three-phase
  rollout (v1 MVP, v2 hardening, v3 multi-dongle mesh) with regulatory
  duty-cycle and TX-access-control enforcement from v1. Targets nRF52840
  first; ESP32-S3 reserved for v2.
- `debug-checkpoint` cargo feature with a dedicated `debug_blink` task and
  a latching atomic checkpoint — LED-pattern diagnostic for UART-only
  boards where defmt output would corrupt the host protocol. Zero
  footprint when the feature is off.

### Changed

- Radio task rewritten as an `hsmc` statechart (`Unconfigured` /
  `Configured.{Idle, StartingRx, Receiving, ResumingRx,
  Transmitting.{FromIdle, FromRx}}`). The main loop is now a single
  `machine.run().await`; command reading, packet RX, and TX are
  state-scoped `during:` activities. Post-TX RX re-arm is modeled as
  state identity (`TransmittingFromRx` → `ResumingRx`) instead of a
  `was_receiving` flag.
- Display task rewritten as an `hsmc` statechart (`Off` /
  `On.{Splash.{LearnMore, Info}, Dashboard.{Listening, Transmitting}}`).
  The 5 s splash alternation and 1 s sparkline tick use `on(after …)` /
  `on(every …)` transitions — no external timer task.
- USB host task now carries a small `hsmc` statechart (`Disconnected` /
  `Connected`) whose entry/exit actions handle display wake, radio
  `StopRx`, and display reset — replacing the open-coded `was_connected`
  edge detector.
- Radio → Display channel switched from a `RadioStatus` watch to a typed
  `RadioEvent` queue. The radio emits discrete `EnteredRx` / `EnteredTx`
  / `Idle` / `PacketRx` / `PacketTx` / `ConfigChanged` events; downstream
  consumers observe transitions directly rather than diffing snapshots.
- Wire protocol types and COBS framing moved out of firmware into the
  shared `donglora-protocol` crate (path dep on `../protocol`). Firmware
  `src/protocol.rs` is now a re-export shim preserving every call site;
  `src/host/framing.rs` keeps only the embassy-specific `route_command`.

### Fixed

- USB disconnect recovery: on a read error the DTR-edge-detect branch
  now runs unconditionally (was early-continuing in some paths, starving
  the display-reset / radio-stop handoff).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- ELECROW ThinkNode-M2 board support (ESP32-S3 + SX1262 + 1.3" SH1106 OLED
  via CP2102 UART bridge, 1000 mAh Li-Po handheld)
  - Pin map verified against Meshtastic's
    `variants/esp32s3/ELECROW-ThinkNode-M2`
  - DIO3 TCXO driven at 3.3 V (not 1.8 V like Heltec)
  - Dedicated `LORA_POWER_EN` (GPIO48) sequenced HIGH before SPI init
  - `VEXT_ENABLE` (GPIO46) is active HIGH — opposite polarity from Heltec
  - Reuses the existing async SH1106 driver at I2C address 0x3C

### Changed

- `hal::esp32s3::{init_spi, init_i2c}` and `board::esp32s3::init_radio` are
  now generic over GPIO type, so ESP32-S3 boards with different pin
  assignments can share the helpers.
- `board::esp32s3::init_radio` takes a `TcxoCtrlVoltage` parameter instead
  of hardcoding `Ctrl1V8` — needed for ThinkNode-M2's 3.3 V TCXO.
- SSD1306 display items in `board::esp32s3` are now cfg-gated to Heltec
  boards (ThinkNode-M2 supplies its own SH1106 `create_display`).
- `justfile` uses `cargo +esp` for Xtensa targets instead of `cargo +nightly`
  with a `RUSTC=esp` override — the self-contained esp toolchain keeps its
  cargo, rustc, and rust-src versions aligned. Public nightly's rust-src
  had drifted ahead of the esp fork, breaking `-Zbuild-std`.
- Migrated to embassy-executor 0.10 and embassy-rp 0.10
- ESP crates (esp-hal, esp-rtos, esp-backtrace, esp-println) patched from
  esp-rs/esp-hal main branch until esp-rtos publishes with 0.10 support
- Adapted to embassy-executor 0.10 SpawnToken API (task functions now return
  `Result<SpawnToken, SpawnError>`, `Spawner::spawn` no longer returns Result)
- Adapted to esp-hal main branch API changes: `efuse::base_mac_address()`,
  `esp_rtos::start` now requires `SoftwareInterrupt`, embassy-rp SPI
  constructor now requires DMA interrupt bindings
- `just check` now runs clippy with `-D warnings` instead of plain `cargo check`
- Rust toolchain bumped to 1.94 in mise.toml

### Fixed

- `core::mem::forget(output)` pattern in ESP32-S3 board files is now
  `let _vext = Output::new(...)` — current esp-hal makes `Output` non-Drop,
  which made `forget` a no-op and tripped clippy's `forget_non_drop` lint.
- UART boards (heltec_v3_uart) display stuck on splash screen after boot.
  Host task sent `DisplayCommand::Reset` (which sets disconnected=true) instead
  of `DisplayCommand::On`. UART has no DTR, so nothing ever cleared it.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- Waveshare RP2040-LoRa board support (RP2040 + SX1262, no OLED, LED on GPIO25)
  - First RP2040 board — third MCU family after ESP32-S3 and nRF52840
  - New `hal/rp2040.rs` module with MCU primitives (SPI, USB, flash unique ID)
  - USB-C via FPC ribbon cable to adapter board
  - PE4259 antenna switch on GPIO17, 850-930 MHz (HF)

### Changed

- `cortex-m-rt/set-vtor` moved from global dependency to per-board feature
  (Cortex-M0+ has no VTOR register)
- `build.rs` memory.x selection is now target-aware (thumbv6m vs thumbv7em)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- Display stuck on status screen after USB disconnect (stale radio status
  updates re-rendered dashboard over splash because `disconnected` flag was
  not set in the `Reset` handler)
- Radio left running after host disconnect, now sends `StopRx` when DTR drops
- System deadlock when host app closes serial port while radio is receiving
  (unsolicited responses in radio task now use `try_send` to avoid blocking
  on a full response channel)
- LED orphaned if OLED display initialization fails (display task now falls
  back to a LED-only event loop instead of returning early)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- Wio Tracker L1 board support (nRF52840 + SX1262, SH1106 OLED)
- LED blink on packet activity: brief flash on RX and TX when display is on
  - RX brightness scales with SNR (stronger signal = brighter)
  - Works on all boards with a user LED (Heltec V3/V4, Wio Tracker)
- Native USB CDC-ACM support for Heltec V3 (requires hardware mod: solder R29/R3)
- `heltec_v3_uart` feature for stock (unmodified) V3 boards via CP2102 bridge
- `RgbLed` trait and `SimpleLed` driver for GPIO-based LEDs
- `LoRaBoard` trait with full associated types (`RadioParts`, `CommParts`,
  `DisplayParts`, `DisplayDriver`, `LedDriver`) and `BoardParts<R, C, D, L>` struct

### Changed

- Major firmware architecture reorganization:
  - `hal/` module for MCU-specific primitives (ESP32-S3, nRF52840)
  - `driver/` module for hardware peripheral drivers (SH1106, SimpleLed)
  - `host/` module for unified USB/UART communication with internal cfg dispatch
  - `board/` contains only board definitions — no MCU helpers or drivers mixed in
  - Board files are declarative wiring diagrams calling hal primitives
- `run()` function has zero board-specific conditional compilation
- Display init moved to board layer (`create_display()`) — display task has no cfg
- Flattened `radio/` and `display/` directories (no single-file directories)
- `build.rs` auto-discovers boards by content (implements `LoRaBoard`) and
  helper modules by `use super::` imports — no exclusion lists
- `check` and `clippy` commands now use `--release` profile
- Deduplicated USB/UART protocol framing (shared `CobsDecoder` + `route_command`)
- Removed `ErrorCode::CrcError` (SX1262 silently drops bad-CRC packets)

### Fixed

- Display stuck on splash screen for UART boards (disconnected flag started true)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Transparent LoRa radio over USB CDC-ACM (VID `1209`, PID `5741`)
- COBS-framed fixed-size LE binary protocol (9 commands, 7 responses)
- Radio configuration: frequency, bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate, TX power
- Continuous RX mode with RSSI/SNR per packet
- Single-shot TX with optional per-packet config override
- SSD1306 OLED display support with status dashboard
  - Radio state, frequency, modulation parameters
  - Packet counters (RX/TX)
  - RSSI sparkline (1-minute history, TX shown as dotted bars)
  - Combined splash/waiting screen on disconnect
- Auto-detect USB host connect/disconnect via DTR
- Config validation against per-board hardware limits
- `TX_POWER_MAX` sentinel (`-128`): auto-use the board's maximum TX power
- Board support: Heltec V3, Heltec V4, RAK WisBlock 4631
- Python host library (`donglora` on PyPI) with `pip install` and `donglora-mux` CLI
- USB multiplexer for sharing one dongle with multiple applications
- Two-way LoRa bridge over TCP (`examples/lora_bridge.py`)

### Technical

- Embassy async runtime (no threads, CPU sleeps when idle)
- Zero-config: boots and waits for host commands
- Protocol-agnostic: firmware has no opinion about what you transmit
- Tasks never panic: all errors reported to host or logged
- Board abstraction: one `.rs` file + one Cargo feature per board
